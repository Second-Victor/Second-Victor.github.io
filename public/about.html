					<h1>About Second<span>Victor</span></h1>

					<p>My name is Allan Davis, and I am an independent iOS app developer with a passion for all things Apple.</p>

					<p>I have been a devout mac user since the very early 2000s as I love the care an attention Apple pour into the devices that they make. In 2007 I purchased the original iPhone and was blown away as soon as I removed it from the box. It was unlike any consumer product released before. It was a stunning piece of engineering paired with an amazing operating system, the device became game changing though when Apple added the App Store in 2008. At that moment, I knew I had to somehow get an app on this tiny device and hopefully become a small part of its story. I decided to teach myself how to code in Objective-C during my spare time.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, life is busy and sometimes it gets in the way of hobby projects, it wasnâ€™t until Apple launched the amazing Swift programming language that software development for me really started to accelerate and I managed to get a couple of my ideas into Xcode and onto the App Store as free apps.</p>

					<p>I am now incredibly lucky to be in a place where I can dedicate nearly all my time to app development. I wanted to approach my independent app development journey "properly," so I registered SecondVictor as a company and I plan to see how far I can go with it.</p>

					<p>I believe that I have some great ideas for apps and small games and can't wait to release them..</p>

					<p>Allan.</p>
