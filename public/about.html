					<h1>About Second<span>Victor</span></h1>

					<p>My name is Allan Davis and I am a independent iOS app developer with a passion for all things Apple.</p>

					<p> I purchased the original iPhone in 2007 and was blown away as soon as I removed it from the box. It was unlike anything released before, but it really became powerful when Apple added the app store in 2008. I knew I had to some how get an app on this tiny device and be a small part of its story. I decided to teach myself how to code in Objective-C during my spare time. Unfortunately sometimes life gets in the way and it wasn't until Apple launched the Swift programming language that I managed to get a couple of my ideas into Xcode and then onto the app store as free apps.</p>

					<p>I am now incredibly lucky to be in a place where i can dedicate all my time to app development. I wanted to do independent app development "properly" so I registered SecondVictor as a company and I plan to see how far I can go with it. I think I have some amazing ideas for apps and small games and can't wait to release them.</p>

					<p>Allan.</p>
