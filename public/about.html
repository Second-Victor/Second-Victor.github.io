					<h2>About Second<span> Victor</span></h2>

					<p>My name is Allan Davis, and I am an independent iOS app developer with a passion for all things Apple.</p>

					<p>I have been a mac user since the very early 2000s as I love the care an attention Apple pour into the devices that they make. In 2007 I purchased the original iPhone and was blown away as soon as I removed it from the box. It was unlike any consumer product released before. It was a stunning piece of engineering paired with an amazing operating system, the device became game changing though when Apple added the App Store in 2008. At that moment, I knew I had to somehow get an app on this tiny device and hopefully become a small part of its story. I decided to teach myself how to code in Objective-C during my spare time.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, life is busy and sometimes it gets in the way of hobby projects, it wasn’t until Apple launched the amazing Swift programming language that software development for me really started to accelerate and I managed to get a couple of my ideas into Xcode and onto the App Store as free apps.</p>

					<p>I am now incredibly lucky to be in a place where I can dedicate nearly all my time to app development. I wanted to approach my independent app development journey "properly," so I registered SecondVictor as a company and I plan to see how far I can go with it.</p>

					<p>I believe that I have some great ideas for apps and small games and can't wait to release them..</p>

					<p>Allan.</p>
