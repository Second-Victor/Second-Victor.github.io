					<h1>About Second<span>Victor</span></h1>

					<p>My name is Allan Davis, and I am an independent iOS app developer with a passion for all things Apple..</p>

					<p>I purchased the original iPhone in 2007 and was blown away as soon as I removed it from the box. It was unlike any consumer product released before. The device truly became powerful when Apple added the App Store in 2008. At that moment, I knew I had to somehow get an app on this tiny device and become a small part of its story. I decided to teach myself how to code in Objective-C during my spare time.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, life is busy and sometimes gets in the way, it wasnâ€™t until Apple launched the amazing Swift programming language that development for me really accelerated and I managed to get a couple of my ideas into Xcode and onto the App Store as free apps.</p>

					<p>I am now incredibly lucky to be in a place where I can dedicate all my time to app development. I wanted to approach independent app development "properly," so I registered SecondVictor as a company and I plan to see how far I can go with it.</p>

					<p>I believe I have some great ideas for apps and small games and can't wait to release them..</p>

					<p>Allan.</p>
