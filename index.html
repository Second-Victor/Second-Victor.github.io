                    <p class="date">24th September 2025</p>

                    <p>App is updated to use Apples liquid Glass UI.</p>

                    <p>I have also done several tweaks and adjustments to how events are added. There will be no pro subscription but I have made it a paid app (its very cheap)</p>

                    <p class="date">5th February 2025</p>

                    <p>I am finished, after a few re-writes and refactors to get the app how I want it I am fairly happy. It is not in its final form yet and I hope the app will evolve over its lifetime.</p>

                    <p>I decided it was best to make the app completly free in its current state, with the hope to maybe add a Pro subscription as the app gets more fleshed out with features.</p>

                    <p class="date">18th November 2024</p>

                    <p>I am almost finished on my first subscription app being released on the App Store. This has been a labour of love and I have thoroughly enjoyed making it.</p>

                    <p>All the code is written for version 1.0.0. I now have to make all of the images for publishing on the App Store so that it can get approved by Apple before being released.</p>

                    <p class="date">17th May 2024</p>

                    <p>I am pleased to announce the launch of my website, I made this small site so that I can link to and also showcase some projects I am working on, hopefully I can document their ongoing development. I expected to have the site up in a day or two but building it took longer than I thought, as I decided to add a bit of web design to my ever evolving skillset. I did this by completing the fantastic web development course by Angela Yu. I redesigned the whole site multiple times before settling on this really minimal theme and layout, Inspired in some part by John Grubers <a href="https://daringfireball.net">daringfireball.net</a>.</p>

                    <p>I am planing to publish regular news about development updates to my software projects. The site may be pretty barebones for a short while so please be patient with me as I slowly add more content.</p>

                    <p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
